# SBA 308A: JavaScript Web Application ðŸ’¾

Created a vanilla Javascript live search feature that allows the user to filter through a set of Tarot Cards. The intention of this assignment is to display an understand of APIs, how to fetch and retrieve data and then apply it to an application. 

There is also a drop down menu to filter the tarot cards by major and minor arcana, a well known categorization for tarot cards. 

# Reflection ðŸ’­

- Admittedly, there was a lot I wanted to do for this project but wasn't sure how to get there. I am glad I utilized the async/await syntax successfully, but I believe in the future I'll refrain from building the DOM inside of the async function. Instead, I'll create two states to account for data retrieval when I don't know how long it may take. First state for no data and have the DOM reflect that in a way that is user friendly and then once the data is successfully retrieved, I'll have the DOM build itself them knowing that the data I need is available and therefore also available to the user to enable a more seamless user experience.
- I also intend to come back and figure out how my linkImages() function because I know if I can get it to work the way I want it to, it can be a really cool function.
- I also did try some new things in the CSS as far as responsiveness goes and dipped into adding some accessibility and readability to my overall design. Eventually I would like to implement more accessibility features and clean up the overall card UI.
