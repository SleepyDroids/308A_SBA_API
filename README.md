# SBA 308A: JavaScript Web Application ðŸ’¾

Created a vanilla Javascript live search feature that allows the user to filter through a set of Tarot Cards. The intention of this assignment is to display an understand of APIs, how to fetch and retrieve data and then apply it to an application. 

There is also a drop down menu to filter the tarot cards by major and minor arcana, a well known categorization for tarot cards. 

# Reflection ðŸ’­

- This was initially a project I was working on solo, but then decided it would work well as a part of the SBA 316's requirements. 
- This didn't 100% turn out the way I wanted it to, but it's closer than what I started with. My intention is to, at some point, add the second die for disadvatange and advantage rolls and have them both displayed to the user. As well as a special indicator for which roll was highest or lowest. 
- I also want to be able to do something with localStorage and have the rolls and character name be kept in case the user wishes to return to the dice roller again and not have to reinsert the same information. 
- Also want to add more dice color options, something similar to a light/dark mode functionality. 
- I know I need to clean up the code and refactor the fucntions using logic so that it's easier for me to manipululate the outputs in the log run. Same goes for reducing the number of event listeners. 
- Overall, I feel like this ultimately became a decent template of an idea I had and one I want to expand upon in the future. ie. Adding different dice types, saving a character's data in terms of their class (and to be able to add modifiers depending on the tabletop), and even a place to store multiple characters with their respective rolls. 
- And I concede that's an ambitious ask as I am still learning, but I want to keep working on this project if for no other reason than continuing to learn and build up my skills with the document object model.
